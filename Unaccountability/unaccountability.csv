173,William Don Gillies v John M’Lean,16 October 1885,(1885) 13 R. 12,"Court of Session, 2d Division, Sheriff of Lanarkshire. I.",1,,All this is very UNACCOUNTABLE and very unsatisfactory.
174,Thomas Scott and Others v James Brown Howard and Another,22 June 1880,(1880) 7 R. 997,"Court of Session, 2d Division",1,,"I think the point (and the pursuers had no other) is too obviously untenable to justify the consumption of time on it, and therefore say at once that I regard the language as merely defensive on the seller’s part, and intended to provide that the buyer shall take the property subject to all burdens and privileges which may exist with respect to it, and find it quite unnecessary, in order to satisfy its meaning, that I should impute to the testamentary trustee who used it such remarkable and UNACCOUNTABLE conduct as the pursuers’ view involves, viz.,"
175,John Park and Robert Park v The Alliance Heritable Security Company (Limited),24 January 1880,(1880) 7 R. 546,"Court of Session, 2d Division",1,,"It appears from the proof that the reason why the earlier titles were not produced and offered by delivery was simply this, not that there was any difficulty in procuring them, but that the conveyancing clerk of the defenders’ agents had, in some UNACCOUNTABLE way, taken up the notion that the titles were hypothecated for a business account in the hands of the pursuers’ law-agent in Glasgow."
176,William Mackenzie v Thomas S. Blakeney,18 July 1879,(1879) 6 R. 1329,"Court of Session, 2d Division Sheriff of Forfarshire. I.",1,,"He was giving an order which he knew perfectly well could not be fulfilled, and therefore he is not entitled to say that if the pursuer had looked into the certificates he would have seen the difficulty, seeing that the pursuer was induced to do what he did by the defender’s UNACCOUNTABLE concealment of the only material fact."
177,"Sir Archibald Douglas Stewart, Bart. v Franc Nichols Steuart",8 November 1878,(1878) 6 R. 145,"Court of Session, 1st Division",1,,"That is a very UNACCOUNTABLE delay; and the only explanation of it that is given is to be found in the 12th article of the condescendence—“So long as the defender claimed the said water-rate or assessment as payable to himself as proprietor of the foresaid portion of the lands of Inchewan, and until it had been decided, as it has now been, that this claim was unfounded, the pursuer was prevented from demanding payment from the defender of the sums sued for in the present action in respect of the water supplied to the parts of the said lands of Inchewan, in the personal occupation of the defender or in the occupation of his tenants.”"
178,The Office of the Judge Promoted by Combe v Edwards,2 November 1878,(1878) 3 P.D. 103,Arches Court of Canterbury,1,,"Now, in dealing with this proposition, the Lord Chief Justice has in the very outset fallen into a signal and UNACCOUNTABLE error of fact."

180,Andrew Aitken and Others (Robert Baird’s Trustees) v Robert Baird and Company,10 July 1877,(1877) 4 R. 1005,"Court of Session, 2d Division",1,,"The reason and object of what appears, at first sight, a strange and UNACCOUNTABLE power or privilege conferred on the tenants is thus explained."
181,Macdonald v Foster,9 June 1877,[1875 M. 29.],Chancery Division,1,,"The convenience of having the sale carried out in the ordinary way in Judge's Chambers is very great, and quite outweighs any advantage to be derived from its taking place in the country, especially in this particular case, in which there has already been such UNACCOUNTABLE delay."
183,In Committee for Privileges v The Montacute and Monthermer Peerages,7 July 1874,(1874-75) L.R. 7 H.L. 305,House of Lords,1,,"After considerable and UNACCOUNTABLE delay a remit was made only to recover receipts and rentals, but not to examine the tenants."
185,"Margaret Wilson or Steuart, now Robertson and Husband v Sir Archibald Douglas Stewart",27 February 1874,(1874) 1 R. 532,"Court of Session, 1st Division Whole Court",1,,"It is not clear, from the Appellant's statements, at what subsequent time he asserts the gift to have been made; but he certainly means to allege it was before the first interest was received by him; if this be so, his offer to pay over that interest to Madame Voyer is UNACCOUNTABLE, and entirely opposed to his pretension that an absolute gift had before that time been made and accepted."
186,Jolliffe and Others v The Wallasey Local Board,13 November 1873,(1873-74) L.R. 9 C.P. 62,Court of Common Pleas,1,,"The mooring-anchor by some means UNACCOUNTABLE for and unknown to the defendants had been lifted from the bed of the river, and the arm of the anchor, instead of resting in a horizontal position upon the bed of the river, had assumed an upright position, and thus had penetrated the bottom of the steam tug-boat."
187,Giacometti v Prodgers,10 July 1872,[1871 G. 51.],Court of Chancery,1,,"The Defendant, on the other hand, denied having been in any way unkind to the Plaintiff, and alleged that it was entirely through her own strange and UNACCOUNTABLE conduct that they had been unable to live together."
189,Henry Thurburn and Another v Robert Steward and Another,26 January 1871,[1869-71] L.R. 3 P.C. 478,Judicial Committee,1,,"It seems that Paterson , after being not much longer than ten years in *487  business, had in some UNACCOUNTABLE way realized a fortune so large as £120,000, yielding him, independently of his continuing business, an income of £7,000 a year."
190,The Office of the Judge promoted by Sheppard v Bennett,20 July 1870,(1869-72) L.R. 3 A. & E. 167,Ecclesiastical,1,,"We contrarywise confess with the fathers, that this manner of presence is UNACCOUNTABLE, and past finding out, not to be searched and pried into by reason, but believed by faith."
191,Stewart v Caledonian Railway Co.,4 February 1870,(1870) 8 M. 486,1st Division. and Ld. Mure.,1,,"But by some singular and UNACCOUNTABLE perverseness, the jury gave only one shilling of damages."
192,Alexander v Officers of State,3 April 1868,(1868) 6 M. (H.L.) 54,House of Lords,1,,"It is idle to stop to inquire how it came into her possession, because the counsel for the appellant have abandoned the hope of establishing the genuineness of the Le Normand documents; but these, as well as those in the De Porquet packet, being produced to the Court at the same time as newly discovered evidence, *65  it is impossible that the undoubted fabrication of one set of documents, both directed to the establishment of similar facts, should not throw considerable suspicion on the others, which came to band at a different time, and under different circumstances, but in a strange and UNACCOUNTABLE manner."
193,Smith and Others v Tebbitt and Others,6 August 1867,(1865-69) L.R. 1 P. & D. 398,Courts of Probate and Divorce,1,,"Things said and done by one sort of person would hardly surprise us, the same words and deeds emanating from another of an opposite character we should esteem so UNACCOUNTABLE as to argue disease."
194,Harriet Caton v R. R. Caton and T. B. Caton,20 May 1867,(1867) L.R. 2 H.L. 127,House of Lords,1,,"Now, it appears to me that the whole conduct of the parties is at variance with any such understanding, and it is UNACCOUNTABLE, if this had really been the case, that it should never have been insisted upon down to the time of the hearing of the present appeal."
196,Daniel Herrick v Garret Sixby ,4 February 1867,"(1867) IV Moore, P.C., N.S. 349",Privy Council (UK),1,,"The provision in the deed, that the hemlock tree should be the south-easterly boundary (that is, should mark the south-eastern corner) of the portion of land intended to be conveyed, is fully and reasonably accounted for if the Appellant's construction be adopted; but quite UNACCOUNTABLE according to the Respondent's view."
197,Gore v Walpole,1 January 1866,[1866] 176 E.R. 751,Assizes,1,,"The examination was then taken into a variety of extraneous topics, in which the plaintiff, however, persisted, apparently not perceiving their entire irrelevancy, and at last he put in a long rambling letter of his to Sir George Grey, and containing most UNACCOUNTABLE statements, the nature of which will be seen in the subsequent evidence."
198,Kamala Naicken v Pitchacootty Chetty ,4 December 1865,"(1865) X Moore, Indian Appeals 386",Privy Council (India),1,,"But if this were the case it is most UNACCOUNTABLE, that the Defendant should have left this complete answer to the Plaintiff's case to the last stage of his pleadings, and even then have introduced it almost incidently as part of a narrative of the transactions between them."
199,Goldsmid v Tunbridge Wells Improvement Commissioners,24 November 1865,(1865-66) L.R. 1 Eq. 161,Equity,1,,"I believe that the water which percolates through the land from the manure placed on it produces no injurious effect at all, and that if the pollution of the stream were to be attributed to that cause the gradual and constant increase of it would be wholly UNACCOUNTABLE."

201,Knight v Knight,20 June 1865,(1865) 4 Swabey & Tristram 103,Knight v Knight,1,,"For some time, by his UNACCOUNTABLE conduct, he tortured his wife by incessant suspicion of his fidelity."

204,Yelverton v Longworth,28 July 1864,(1864) 2 M. (H.L.) 49,No. 7,1,,"But if it be held that this charter is in its nature and intent a mere supplementary deed, and, although in the form of a charter of novodamus , was truly intended merely to operate a modification in the terms of the original contract between superior and vassal, much of the difficulty pressed on the part of the pursuer disappears, and it becomes legitimate to look to the deed of 1810 for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not what would otherwise appear to be UNACCOUNTABLE omissions from the charter of 1817 exist in the prior deed."
205,Timothy Tyrrell v The Bank of London and Sir J. V. Shelley and Others,27 February 1862,(1862) X House of Lords Cases (Clark's) 26,House of Lords,1,,"Again, it strikes me as most UNACCOUNTABLE, that if Tyrrell did not believe this offer to be a pure fiction, he should not have demanded an explanation from Read of all the particulars respecting it."
206,Charles Henry Humphrey and John Christian v William Nowland ,6 February 1862,(1862) XV Moore 343,Privy Council (UK),1,,"And, if it was of the value which it has assumed in the action, and the Plaintiff had not cattle enough to stock the land (which appears to have been the case), it is still more UNACCOUNTABLE that he should have retained the precarious use of it, constantly liable to disturbance as it was from his inability thoroughly to use it, and should not have availed himself of the profit which he might have acquired by the transfer of his possession."
207,JAMES COSNAHAN v ELEANOR GRICE,12 July 1862,(1862) XV Moore 215,Privy Council (UK),1,,"Now, it certainly is most UNACCOUNTABLE that the deceased, who was thus contemplating the disposition of her property by Will, should, at the very moment when she must actually have given instructions for it, have been making a loose and informal gift of almost the whole of her personal estate."
208,"Sir Robert Stanford, Knt. v George David Brunette, Falkner Hope, and Johan Georg Steytler ",26 June 1860,(1860) XIV Moore 35,Privy Council (UK),1,,"I have been, since my return, promised by Captain Hope to be furnished with a copy of it, but for some UNACCOUNTABLE reason I have not been furnished with it."
209,Merry and Cunninghame v Brown,15 July 1859,(1859) 21 D. 1337,2d Division.,1,,"If parties clearly express themselves to such an effect, in a formal and well considered and deliberately prepared contract, they will be bound, however unreasonable and absurd, and unjust the bargain may be; but I am not acquainted with any principle of construction, which should lead the Court to wrest the loose shorthand form of expression we have before us here to a meaning so strange and UNACCOUNTABLE."
210,De Mattos v Gibson,27 May 1859,(1859) 4 De Gex & Jones 276,QB,1,,"From this time there is again an UNACCOUNTABLE delay on the part of the Plaintiff until the month of September, when, upon an apprehension (as it is said) that Gibson might exercise his power of sale without notice to the purchaser of the charter-party, he filed a bill on the 15th September against Gibson only, praying that he might be restrained from selling the vessel otherwise than subject to the burthen of the charter-party."
212,M'Naughton v Caledonian Railway Co.,17 December 1858,(1858) 21 D. 160,2d Division.,1,,"But, if the whole enactment relates to contracts only, the words “notices, conditions and declarations” are UNACCOUNTABLE."
213,Mansergh v Campbell,18 November 1858,(1858) 3 De Gex & Jones 232,Ct of Chancery,1,,"It would certainly appear strange, although perhaps not altogether UNACCOUNTABLE, that the testator should have first given an annuity merely for life and then have directed that life annuity to be sold; but it seems still more extraordinary that even supposing all the children to have lived till the period of sale, so as to leave the aggregate annuity of £300 divisible amongst them all, then the sale must have been not of an annuity of £300 as the testator directed, but of so many annuities as there were lives, the annuities being of different values according to the probable duration of the lives, depending not only upon their respective ages, but also upon the strength or weakness of their constitutions."
214,Alexander Murray,15 November 1858,(1858) 3 Irvine 262,The High Court and Circuit Courts of Justiciary.,1,,"2d Reason—The act was preceded by a condition very similar, and his illness in London, in December 1857,—low, restless, anxious melancholia,—UNACCOUNTABLE to himself, increasing gradually, and the date of the deed not like delirium tremens , and neither preceeded nor followed by delirium tremens , and brought on by only two days drinking."

217,"Francis Tummons v Richard Ogle, Green and Pike",27 May 1856,[1856] 119 E.R. 977,NA,1,,"It is UNACCOUNTABLE to me why, if the mere form of the action is varied, and is replevin, the party may not come into the Superior Courts unless he can get sureties to be bound for him, who, if he fail in the action, are to be liable for him, and, as Mr."
218,The “Fenix.”,20 December 1855,(1855) Swabey 13,High Court of Admiralty,1,,"It appeared that at midday, on the 19th of August, by some UNACCOUNTABLE neglect, the “Fenix” came in contact with this ship—the “Mobile”; the “Fenix” being a brig of between 200 and 300 tons, and the “Mobile” a vessel of 1000 and odd tons."
219,The “General de Caen”—(Guichon) Master,8 December 1855,(1855) Swabey 9,High Court of Admiralty,1,,"The pilot gave his proper orders to luff, but the man, by some UNACCOUNTABLE mistake, misunderstood the order, and did the opposite to what he was told."

221,William Macintosh and v William Wilson.,17 March 1855,(1855) 2 Irvine 136,High Court and Circuit Courts of Justiciary.,1,,"My Lords, I cannot conceive—having now had much experience in these railway trials, and looking with great anxiety to the course of proceedings elsewhere, and into the nature of these accidents—I cannot conceive a fault so grave, a fault so strange and so UNACCOUNTABLE, as that of which Macintosh has been found guilty."
222,George Lillie Smith and v Robert Campbell,15 January 1855,(1855) 2 Irvine 1,High Court and Circuit Courts of Justiciary.,1,,"If all the changes that took place in this unhappy and unfortunate man were the result of loose and dissolute habits—first in eccentricity indicated by recklessness of conduct, then in a disregard of public opinion, and then in confirmed habits of intemperance—melancholy as these may be, you must not allow your minds to be blinded by compassion into the notion that he was insane; because this may appear to be an UNACCOUNTABLE, a singular, and an improbable declension in such a person."
223,Evans v Coventry,1 December 1854,(1854) 3 Drewry 75,Court of Chancery,1,,"That is another strange and UNACCOUNTABLE circumstance, but so it is."
224,The “Fidentia”—(Serlachius),14 November 1854,(1854) Spinks' Prize Cases 85,Ct of Admiralty,1,,"It is rather, I confess, to me a startling circumstance, that a merchant making a consignment at that period, especially under the circumstances of this case, who wrote letters representing what was to be done with the cargo when it arrived in Finland, should by some UNACCOUNTABLE accident not have entered them in the letter-book."
225,William Smith,14 April 1854,(1854) 1 Irvine 378,The High Court and Circuit Courts of Justiciary.,1,,"The case was UNACCOUNTABLE, upon any other footing but that this crime had been projected and prepared in the mind of the prisoner from the first time that this matter of the insurances began, until Saturday the 19th of November 1853."

228,Percival v Caney,2 August 1852,(1852) 4 De Gex & Smale 610,Court of Chancery,1,,"Their conclusions are stated very distinctly and positively, and are of such a nature as to render it altogether UNACCOUNTABLE that proceedings were not taken by some of her relations for the protection of the intestate and her property during the long period to which the witnesses speak."
229,Reynell v Sprye,15 March 1852,(1852) 1 De Gex Macnaghten & Gordon 660,Ct of Chancery,1,,"But, thirdly, suppose that this was not so—suppose, however UNACCOUNTABLE it may be, that Capt."
230,Fisher's Trustees v Fisher,5 December 1850,(1850) 13 D. 245,2d Division.,1,,"But, in this present question, I rest on the distinct statement of Mrs Fisher herself, in the probative writ under her hand, as to the nature of the debt constituted by the bond of Messrs Sandemans, which I apprehend cannot be overcome by the loose, and perhaps UNACCOUNTABLE terms, either of the bond or of the discharge, and far less by the mere suspicion of some unfair dealing, of which there is neither any evidence, nor, in my humble opinion, any reasonable ground of probability."
231,Cullen v Gossage,1 February 1850,(1850) 12 D. 633,2d Division.,1,,"But, in the circumstances, as she had no evidence on the one hand, and as Gossage was plainly treating her with neglect as well as cruelty, if not disowning her claim on him, it is quite UNACCOUNTABLE, on any knowledge one has of human nature, or of what a Scotchwoman would in such circumstances do on returning to Scotland, that she should not have discussed this point with White and his sister, obtained their advice and aid, and, through them or her brother, acquired evidence of the marriage, or declarations from the parties said to have been present, if it was not registered."
232,Reid v Langlois,20 December 1849,(1849) 1 Macnaghten & Gordon 627,Ch D,1,,"[640] [His Lordship then adverted to the time when the action was commenced, to the filing of the bill, and to the date of the subsequent proceedings, and observed:]— The UNACCOUNTABLE delay which has taken place would of itself be conclusive against the application of the Plaintiffs to enlarge the time, for parties seeking a discovery in aid of their defence to an action at law are not to be permitted to wait until the action is on the eve of trial, and then to ask the Court to make an order, the effect of which must be to postpone the trial."
233,Couper v Young,28 November 1849,(1849) 12 D. 190,1st Division.,1,,"You have that apparent in all the intermediate transactions; and it is an UNACCOUNTABLE circumstance, that if it had been intended to revive the extinct bills, it should not have been mentioned cither in the pass-book or on the bills."
234,Thomson v Lindsay,27 February 1849,(1849) 11 D. 719,No. 132.,1,,"If the petitioner's case does not fall within *759  the first portion of the Act 1579, nor within the provisions of the Act 1663 and 1672, and if he, and all others similarly situated, are entitled to relief under the charity of the second part of the Act 1579, it is most UNACCOUNTABLE that the legislature should never have thought of any regulation for providing and forcing work from such parties."
235,Paterson v Paterson,24 January 1849,(1849) 11 D. 421,1st Division.,1,,"I feel great difficulty in this case—not, however, on the comparative merits of the conduct of these parties; for I see no imputation whatever on the character or conduct of the pursuer; while on the other hand I think the conduct of the defender, whether it be tried by the laws of religion and morality, or by the more worldly code of honour and gentlemanlike feeling, is equally UNACCOUNTABLE and indefensible."
236,Sandeman v Scott,23 January 1849,(1849) 11 D. 405,1st Division.,1,,"But by a strange and to me most UNACCOUNTABLE arithmetical juggle, this interest of four per cent."
237,Clyne's Trustees v Clyne,17 June 1848,(1848) 10 D. 1325,2d Division.,1,,"How they should have entrusted such a person with the whole command of the trust-funds, and the unlimited right to use, apply, and spend them as he pleased, would be UNACCOUNTABLE but for one prominent fact in the case, which the statements of the trustees in this case, and the opinions of the First Division in the case between them and Manson, force on our notice as a very leading feature in the case—which I believe explains the utter neglect of the trust by some of the intelligent men of business who unfortunately accepted."
238,"Frederick Squire, Richard King, and John Squire v Mary Philippa Whitton",14 February 1848,(1848) I House of Lords Cases (Clark's) 333,House of Lords,1,,"Whitton; for, to make short of my story, William (the writer's eldest son) in my absence, entered into a speculation most UNACCOUNTABLE, which I have to make good in seven days from the present; and in order to give time to realize other securities, may I ask the favour of you to join me in a bond for £10,000, which will give me time to make arrangements."
239,Mackenzie v Stewart,5 February 1848,(1848) 10 D. 611,1st Division.,1,,"As to the defender's admission, that he only lent the pursuer a pound on one occasion, which has been founded on in his favour, though it may fairly be viewed as evidence of his niggardly disposition, yet, on the supposition of this matrimonial union, his failure to provide for her wants is at least equally UNACCOUNTABLE."
240,M'Manimy & Higgans,28 June 1847,(1847) Ark. 321,The High Court and Circuit Courts of Justiciary.,1,,"While the crime argued a very bad feeling on the part of M'Manimy, it was certainly most singular and UNACCOUNTABLE, that the other pannel Higgans, without any apparent motive, should have joined in this criminal plan, and agreed to be the active agent in conducting the sick man to Glasgow, and thereafter deserting him, and leaving him exposed."
242,Francis Hart Dyke v Thomas Walford ,11 December 1846,"(1846) V Moore, P.C. 434",Privy Council (UK),1,,"This you refused, for reasons which are altogether UNACCOUNTABLE to me."
243,Macaulay v Buist & Co.,9 December 1846,(1846) 9 D. 245,1st Division.,1,,"Is not a jury fairly entitled to hold, on a question of fact, that such was the case here? And what is the answer of the defenders? That it may have arisen from some damnum fatale , some UNACCOUNTABLE failure of the machine, against which no human foresight could guard."
244,The Marquess of Breadalbane v M'Gregor and Others,3 December 1846,(1846) 9 D. 210,1st Division.,1,,It is said to be UNACCOUNTABLE why they should not have paid for the road as well as the stance—but the reason of this is obvious.
245,Frere v Peacocke,6 August 1846,[1846] 163 E.R. 1095,Court of King's Bench,1,,"“The conduct which he held to his brother certainly is considerably UNACCOUNTABLE; if, whenever his brother's name occurred, instantly a fit of delirium had seized him, then I should conceive he was not competent to make his will; but if his mind remained entire, if he had new raised up prejudices against his brother, though upon improper grounds, yet if they were such prejudices as might reside in a sound mind, it is hard that those prejudices should lead to conclusions unfavorable to his brother; but hard as the case may be, it is better that a thousand hard cases should take place than that we should remove the landmarks by which man's property is to be decided."
247,Lindsay v Giles,27 February 1844,(1844) 6 D. 771,2d Division.,1,,"Accordingly, when the case was afterwards sent to avizandum on a short answer for the pursuer on 8th February, after an UNACCOUNTABLE delay by the pursuer of three weeks, the Sheriff in a few days pronounced the proper interlocutor, admitting Walker's compearance, and renewing the decree against the principal debtor, and allowing extract thereof to go out immediately, on the very ratio that the compearance imported that the advocator ‘merely craves to be preferred as a prior bondholder to the rents, for which decree against the tenants has been given.’"
248,Christian Gilmour,13 January 1844,(1844) 2 Broun 23,The High Court and Circuit Courts of Justiciary.,1,,"Then, again, if she was guilty, it is UNACCOUNTABLE that she should have manifested no aversion or disinclination to permit access to her husband during his illness; but without the slightest dread of the consequences, should on the contrary have permitted the servants and inmates of the house—all, indeed, who chose—to approach the sick-bed *64  as freely as herself."
249,Greenwood v Greenwood,1 January 1844,(1844) 1 Robertson Ecclesiastical 868,Court of King's Bench,1,,"Gentlemen,—The conduct which he held to his brother certainly is considerably UNACCOUNTABLE—if whenever his brother's name occurred, instantly a fit of delirium had seized him, then I should conceive that he was not competent to make his will; but if his mind remained entire, if he had new raised up prejudices against his brother, though upon improper grounds, yet if they were such prejudices as might reside in a sound mind, it is hard that those prejudices should lead to conclusions unfavourable to his brother; but hard as the case may be, it is better that a thousand hard cases should take place, than that we should remove the landmarks by which man's property is to be decided."
250,Kirkpatrick v Donaldson,2 June 1843,(1843) 5 D. 1104,2d Division.,1,,"Whyte having very naturally suspected, from what he had seen, that the carnal intercourse between the parties, which is now averred by the pursuer to have taken place in that plantation, on the occasion in question, had been the real explanation of the lengthened absence, which he and his companions had previously considered so UNACCOUNTABLE, he immediately began to joke her upon the subject, at which she is said to have laughed; and the defender himself having soon afterwards come to the moss with a hammer and nails to mend the pursuer's peat barrow, apparently in consequence of having been asked by the pursuer to do so at their previous meeting, Whyte began to joke him also on the same subject, when the disgusting conversation, referred to in the proof, ensued betwixt Whyte and the defender."
251,Cruickshank v Gordon,10 March 1843,(1843) 5 D. 909,1st Division.,1,,"Having expressly bound themselves to admit a qualified presentee, if after examining him, and finding him qualified, the Presbytery, from some strange and UNACCOUNTABLE caprice, or in order to allow the illegal presentee of some unauthorized party to interfere with the appointment of the legal patron, should stop short, upon what ground can it be maintained that the contract on this point could not be enforced just as all other contracts would be? Were it otherwise, it was a very idle stipulation on the part of the State, and utterly dishonest in the Church to procure advantages upon an undertaking which they might disregard if they chose, and which the other contracting party had no means to enforce."
252,MacAlister v Alexander,14 February 1843,(1843) 5 D. 580,2d Division.,1,,"This was an UNACCOUNTABLE neglect on the part of the directors, to allow the concern to go on for a considerable period without any books, especially when they were bound to exhibit to the shareholders an annual balance sheet."

255,Regina v Harris and Twenty-eight Others,3 October 1842,(1842) Carrington and Marshman 661,Assizes,1,,"If there is one right which, beyond all others, the labourer ought to be able to call his own, it is the right of the exertion of his own personal strength and skill, in the full enjoyment of his own free will, altogether unshackled by the control or dictates of his fellow-workmen; yet, strange to say, this very right, which the discontented workman claims for himself to its fullest extent, he does, by a blind perversity and UNACCOUNTABLE selfishness entirely refuse to his fellows who differ in opinion from himself."
256,Middleton v Anderson,10 March 1842,(1842) 4 D. 957,1st Division.,1,,"This is certainly, to me, a very novel and UNACCOUNTABLE way, to say the least of it, of treating reasons of complaint and appeals."
257,Milne v Thomson,6 July 1841,(1841) 3 D. 1163,2d Division.,1,,"But the Onus of proving a case to exclude this, is clearly on the pursuer; and if it be wore probable, or even nearly as probable, as what he avers, this is more than sufficient to dispose of a penal action like the present, instituted after so long and UNACCOUNTABLE a delay.”"
258,M'Pherson v Christie,26 May 1841,(1841) 3 D. 930,2d Division.,1,,"But it is conceivable enough that, in the hurry of divesting himself of his wrappings and getting in to his dinner, he might forget for the moment that he had not taken it up again and secured it; and in the same way the Lord Ordinary, not being able to conceive that any man should knowingly throw off his greatcoat and see it hung on a stair rail, with a valuable pocket-book loose in its shallow breast-pocket, without at least charging the attendants to be careful of it on account of its contents, must (and does) believe that the otherwise UNACCOUNTABLE conduct of the respondent was truly owing to his having entirely forgotten, for the time, that there was any such precious deposit to he provided for, and can therefore as little throw over on the innkeeper the loss, which was the natural consequence of his forgetfulness, in the one case more than ill the other."
259,Farquhar's Trustees v Stewart,27 February 1841,(1841) 3 D. 658,2d Division.,1,,"It seems equally UNACCOUNTABLE, on the supposition of it being an ordinary loan, and as such composing so considerable a portion of his funds, that the will of Mr Farquhar should totally omit all notice of the existence of so large an outstanding debt, or any direction to his executors to collect it, or take any measures regarding it, though he must have been thoroughly aware, that their calling upon his son-in-law to pay up so large a sum, or even to give effectual security for it to his executors, must have been attended with the greatest possible embarrassment to him."

Thomas Knight, Clerk, Plaintiff v and The Marquess of Waterford and Others, and George Adam Askew and Others",17 December 1839,(1841) 4 Younge and Collyer 283,Court of King's Bench,1,,"The omission, therefore, to tax this sum, if it were really paid, is UNACCOUNTABLE, particularly as at that time this sum was very great."
261,Regina v Edward Oxford,9 July 1840,(1840) 9 Carrington and Payne 525,Assizes,1,,"Justice Tracey observed “that the defence of insanity must be clearly made out; that it is not every idle or frantic humour of a man, or something UNACCOUNTABLE in his actions, which will shew him to be such a madman as to exempt him from punishment.”—In"

263,Browne v Lockhart,21 January 1840,(1840) 10 Simons 420,Court of Chancery,1,,"With respect to the case cited from Mosley: in the first place, Mosley is not a reporter of very great authority; and I confess that it seems to me to be most extra- *680  ordinary that, after a decree nisi for a foreclosure had been made, an application should be made, by the mortgagor, that the mortgagee should produce his deed, in order that it might be laid before a conveyancer, to enable him to draw an assignment of the mortgage to some person who might be disposed to lend the money to pay off the first mortgage; and, what is still more UNACCOUNTABLE, the Court granted the motion."
264,Dill v Houston's Trustees,7 December 1839,(1839) 2 D. 214,2d Division.,1,,"Even if it were to be held, therefore, that the wife was the proper beneficiary as to this sum, from the first constitution of the trust, the insertion of this specific power of appointment would not be either superfluous or UNACCOUNTABLE; since, without it, not such power could be competently exercised during the subsistence of the marriage."

Stewart, and Attorney and Mandatory",3 June 1839,(1839) Maclean & Robinson 401,House of Lords,1,,"Upon the circumstances admitted or proved it was clear, that, by some UNACCOUNTABLE mistake, which has never been explained, the appellant, a stranger to the law of Scotland, was entirely misled and deceived as to her rights, even under that law."
267,Lord Blantyre v Kennedy,4 December 1838,(1838) 1 D. 148,1st Division.,1,,"It seems UNACCOUNTABLE, therefore, that a privilege which the monks themselves did not possess, should be enjoyed by their laic successors."

269,Kirkland v Cadell,9 March 1838,(1838) 16 S. 860,2d Division,1,,"Now, it is most UNACCOUNTABLE that even these proceedings did not awaken this body of creditors from the slumber from which they ought to have been roused; on the contrary, they absolutely dreamed that this award of Mr Cockburn's was final and conclusive as to the interest of all concerned."
270,Gordon v Glendonwyn,23 February 1838,(1838) 16 S. 645,1st Division,1,,"But, in this Court, we have had too much occasion to be aware that even a delay like this, is, in the case of her ladyship, less UNACCOUNTABLE than it would be in the case of most other persons, supposing the debt to be truly due."
271,Attorney-General v Lubbock. (Morden College.),6 November 1837,(1837) C. P. Cooper 15,Ct of Chancery,1,,"Forster , 2 Peere Williams, 325, the case of the Birmingham Grammar School, heard by Lord King, assisted by Chief Justice Eyre and Chief Baron Gilbert, it is said, “in those cases where the governors or visitors are said not to be accountable, it must be intended where such governors have the power of Government only, and not where they have the legal estate and are intrusted with the receipt of rents and profits; for it would be of the most pernicious consequence imaginable, that any persons intrusted with the receipts of rents and profits, and especially for a charity, though they misemploy never so much these rents and profits, should yet be UNACCOUNTABLE for these receipts; this would be such a privilege as might of itself be a temptation to a breach of trust.”"
272,Wishaw Railway Company v Steuart's Representatives,1 March 1837,(1837) 15 S. 703,2d Division R,1,,"Their denial of the authenticity of the copy of the proposals in process, and their professions of their ignorante of any document of such a tenor, are, to say the least of them, altogether UNACCOUNTABLE, and, so far as the Lord Ordinary's experience goes, without example in litigations with persons of their condition."
273,Gifford v Gifford,17 February 1837,(1837) 15 S. 592,2d Division. R,1,,"They vacillated, and in a way which is UNACCOUNTABLE, except on the idea that they had misgivings; and while they avoided taking any course likely to bring matters to a crisis, manœuvred to make Gideon's legitimacy be received by the world without discussion."

276,Sayer v Birchmore,15 April 1836,(1836) Donnelly 56,Ct of Chancery,1,,"In the present case the Plaintiffs did know of the proceedings, but did not prosecute their claims before the Master; and that they knew of the proceedings was proved by the letter of their solicitor, which was written in 1833, and which was to the following effect: That their clients (meaning the present Plaintiffs), had put into their hands the papers and documents supporting their claims as next of kin, which papers and documents had been lodged with two different solicitors, for the purpose of carrying in such claims before the Master, and which then appeared, by some UNACCOUNTABLE negligence, was not prosecuted."
277,Lippmann v Don,20 January 1836,(1836) 14 S. 241,1st Division,1,,"The UNACCOUNTABLE delay in making a demand of payment, and the ultimate institution of proceedings so soon after the death of the alleged debtor not only exposed the claim to much suspicion, but rendered it unfit to ground an action in this country."
279,Fruser v Fraser's Trustees,7 November 1834,(1834) 13 S. 703,1st Division,1,,"But what imaginable apology can be made for their not letting this sum remain in the bank till such investment was obtained? Their needlessly drawing it out, and placing it for an indefinite time in the hands of one of their number, was not an omission, but an act and intromission of the most UNACCOUNTABLE, and, it appears to the Lord Ordinary, the most indefensible character; and it is for this accordingly that he has found them liable."
280,Swift v Swift ,9 July 1833,(1833) III Knapp 303,Privy Council (UK),1,,"Supposing a marriage had taken place, and all these cohabitations that are pleaded, it is a most UNACCOUNTABLE thing that, travelling with his brother-in-law, from Rome to Naples, and after Mrs."

S. 90",House of Lords,1,,"If they had been equally interested I can conceive that it might have been left without making any memorandum; but as one had double the interest of the other it is utterly UNACCOUNTABLE, if it was not a partnership transaction, how it should have found its way into the books, and continued all along without a single note, or memorandum, or mark to distinguish it."

285,Ingram v Wyatt,1 January 1828,[1828] 162 E.R. 621,Court of King's Bench,1,,"On any other supposition, indeed, his conduct would be most strange and UNACCOUNTABLE; since, if he had been aware, as it had been insinuated he was, that his Lordship was no party to the sale, was it likely he would have rested satisfied [85] with a contract, in which he was himself the only person that was bound? His subsequent conduct, however, abundantly proved that he did not so understand it."
286,Collins v Hare,1 January 1828,(1828) I Dow & Clark 139,House of Lords,1,,"Argued for the Respondent: The transaction itself afforded intrinsical evidence of fraud and undue influence, since the affair was UNACCOUNTABLE, except upon the supposition, which was warranted by the evidence, that Atkinson acted under the apprehension that Collins would destroy the credit of the house by [148] exposing the manner in which the accounts had been kept; and as to the £100 given to Collins by the codicil, that was given under the same apprehension, and it was in evidence that Collins boasted that it depended on him whether there would be any codicil at all."

290,  Brett v Brett,1 January 1826,(1826) 3 Addams 210,Court of King's Bench,1,,"At all events, it seems to me full as UNACCOUNTABLE that this act should be so entitled if meant to affect personal estate, as that Lord Hardwick should have used the phrase “any will or codicil” in the sense of “any will or codicil of real estate”—limited, as the phrase is, to that sense by its whole context."
291,“Woodbridge”—(Munnings),23 July 1822,(1822) 1 Haggard 63,High Court of Admiralty,1,,"It is a duty, very painful in the discharge, to wade through such a mass of matter, without a prospect of being able to extricate the parties from the state of inconvenience into which they have been dragged by some UNACCOUNTABLE acts of negligence, by improper indulgence of passion and ill humour, and by the unfortunate advice to which they have submitted."
292,Johnes v Lloyd,27 January 1822,(1822) 10 Price 62,Court of Exchequer,1,,"It is a very UNACCOUNTABLE and unintelligible charge; and if it were any thing that could be insisted upon, it can only be as a gift; and if so, it cannot be urged, under the circumstances, as a demand subsisting against Johnes."

295,The Attorney-General v Hartley,18 December 1820,(1820) 2 Jacob & Walker 353,Ct of Chancery,1,,"This also is a strong passage to show, that at that time there was only one school, and that that was a grammar school; for when the commissioners adverted to the fact that there was a school and a schoolmaster without proper provisions, requiring to be regulated, it is UNACCOUNTABLE that they should make no provision about any other school, if there was any other, and I therefore feel this to be very strong evidence to show, that at that time of day, the construction which had been actually put on these several grants, independently of so much of their contents as devotes a part of the revenues to the poor, did provide an application of the rents and profits of all of them, as far as the school was concerned, to one school only, that school being a grammar school."

300,Layng v Yarborough,12 July 1817,(1817) 4 Price 383,Court of Exchequer,1,,"How can that consist? The first proposition was, that the renew cow paid only a penny halfpenny for milk; then they say the renew cow does not pay a penny halfpenny for the milk, but the modus dances, shifts, and leaps from the simple subject of the milk, and is confounded with the two other subjects; and by a most UNACCOUNTABLE effect, that cow, which in respect of its milk pays only a penny halfpenny when she has ten calves, pays five shillings in lieu of the penny halfpenny; and so when there are five calves, two shillings and sixpence is to be paid in lieu of that one penny halfpenny."

315,Corporation of Kingston upon Hull v Horner,1 January 1774,(1774) Lofft 576,Court of King's Bench,1,,"It is UNACCOUNTABLE how the word port should have escaped those charters if ever thought of, or how not thought of if there was a port before the time of R."
316,Insurance,1 January 1773,(1773) Lofft 212,Court of King's Bench,1,,"If he had, he might have seen that ships had gone out about the time that this ship of the defendant's did go, and were lost; that as to the date of the letter, it was very remarkable that [213] the under-writer should not take notice of this, either mistake or misrepresentation, till the ship was lost; which, it was observed, looked like UNACCOUNTABLE laches or craft on that side."
317,Somerset v Stewart,14 May 1772,(1772) Lofft 1,Court of King's Bench,1,,"Stewart; even a supposed one: for till the matter was determined, it were somewhat UNACCOUNTABLE that a negro should depart his service, and put the means out of his power of trying that right to effect, by a flight out of the kingdom."
318,Brown v Kenyon. H. T.,1 January 1767,(1767) Burrell 30,High Court of Admiralty,1,,"On the whole of the evidence the Judge gave sentence, and in a very UNACCOUNTABLE manner condemned the prosecutor in costs, though the defendants own they had prohibited commodities on board, which must justify the seizure, though they should not be forfeited, and though the defendants should exculpate themselves."
319,"Allen Evans, Esquire v Sir Thomas Harrison, Knight, Chamberlain of London",5 July 1762,(1762) Wilmot 130,Court of King's Bench,1,,"Fitzherbert was of *61  a different opinion as to the rule itself; and it does seem to be very UNACCOUNTABLE, that a man should be at liberty to avoid his own act, by the duress of man, and not by the duress of Heaven: and the reason given for it in the books, that a man cannot know what he did when he was mad, is to me quite unintelligible; for what inconsistency is there in saying, he does not know he ever did such an act; but if he did, he was mad when he did it? The best and the truest reason seems to be, that the law has directed a particular mode of inquiry for the manifestation of insanity, and avoiding the acts of persons under that unhappy visitation."
320,Lancaster v Thornton,12 June 1760,(1760) 2 Burrow 1027,Court of King's Bench,1,,"Ashhurst says, can not be complied with, in this case, without an implication of a devise to the executors; because it must otherwise descend to the heir at law in the mean time; who, he says, would not be chargeable with the intermediate rents and profits, but altogether UNACCOUNTABLE for them."
321,Fawcet v Lowther,15 June 1751,(1751) 2 Vesey Senior 300,Ct of Chancery,1,,"Though a custom for a copyholder for life to commit waste would not be good; yet for a copyholder in fee to do so it is good; though much more diminishing the Lord's estate; and much more UNACCOUNTABLE how such a custom should grow up, than this."
322,Lord Teynham v Webb,2 March 1751,(1751) 2 Vesey Senior 198,Ct of Chancery,1,,"But to consider it in the third view, here is a grand-mother, who knew the settlement made on her daughter's marriage with the late Lord Teynham , and that it was a settlement of the whole estate on the eldest son for the time being, without any provision for the [203] younger children, although she brought a fortune of £12,000 which UNACCOUNTABLE defect she had a mind to remedy in some degree, but could not do it completely; for if it had been a provision in a marriage-settlement for portions, maintenance would be directed for the younger children after death of the father; so that she did it in some degree, but still leaving it in some measure to Lord Teynham."
323,The Bishop of Cloyne v Young,7 December 1750,(1750) 2 Vesey Senior 91,Ct of Chancery,1,,"Certainly it is by no means sufficient of itself to exclude the executors, or either of them, from the surplus; but when taken with the other circumstances, and with the inchoate disposition afterward, it corroborates this opinion; for it is UNACCOUNTABLE, that if a man intended to give the surplus of his personal estate to these two executors, he should, when so great a surplus came to be divided between them, give to one a debt from the other, and not rather leave that debt at home."
324,"The Earl of Chesterfield and Others, Executors of John Spencer Esq. v Sir Abraham Janssen, Baronet",18 June 1750,(1750) 1 Atkyns 301,Ct of Chancery,1,,"People have as many ways of running out, as getting estates, UNACCOUNTABLE how: He had contracted £20,000 debts, and debts to tradesmen, as is insisted on our side; the witnesses swear that he was pressed by tradesmen, and that the debts amounted to this sum."
325,Visitors,1 January 1744,(1744) 2 Equity Cases Abridged 751,Ct of Chancery,,1,", should yet be UNACCOUNTABLE for their Receipts; this would be such a Privilege as might of itself be a Temptation to a Breach of Trust.—Fifthly,"
326,Coulson v Coulson,1 January 1739,(1739) 2 Strange 1125,Court of King's Bench,1,,"To the rest of mankind it must remain UNACCOUNTABLE, and therefore be often unattended to, that a manifest design to give an estate for life to the first taker, will be frustrated by the use of the word heirs, &c."
327,John Middleton and Ann his Wife v Thomas Crofts,1 January 1736,(1736) 2 Atkyns 650,Ct of Chancery,1,,"To this way of arguing it hath been objected, that the reason of establishing provisions of this kind by acts of parliament, was for the sake of enforcing them by civil sanctions and temporal penalties, which could not otherwise be obtained, and undoubtedly this was one reason for it; but I cannot be persuaded that it was the only reason, since if it had been the prevailing opinion of those times, that the clergy in convocation could make new canons to bind the laity, it is most UNACCOUNTABLE that they should not think it proper to trust any regulations of the most minute consesequence to the proper force of canon or synodical decree, which if lawfully made might be carried into execution by excommunication, and the consequences attending upon it were a sanction fully sufficient to enforce it."
328,The King v Dr. Bettesworth,1 January 1733,(1733) W. Kelynge 156,Ct of Chancery,1,,"Supposing therefore she should never exhibit, it seems UNACCOUNTABLE that this should prevent the next of Kin from having Administration."
329,Pratt and Pratt,"29 May, 1731",(1730) Fitz-Gibbon 284,Court of King's Bench,1,,"Master of the Rolls: The heir at law, in the statute, is in the singular number, and therefore it is UNACCOUNTABLE how the words, any child or children, not being heir at law, came to be thrown in."
330,John Astell v John Andrews,1 January 1726,(1726) 2 Lord Raymond 1421,Court of King's Bench,1,,for otherwise the expression in the Act is UNACCOUNTABLE.
331,The Case of Birmingham School,1 January 1726,(1726) Gilbert 178,Ct of Chancery,,1,"But because an Act of Parliament lodges the Visitatorial Power in the Governors, who have the Revenue, and expresly thereby makes them UNACCOUNTABLE; this will be no Rule to expound the King's Grant by that which appoints Governors of an Hospital, and makes them a Corporation, and lodges the Revenue in them."
332,Eden v Foster,3 July 1725,(1725) Select Cases Temp. King 36,Ct of Chancery,1,,"But if there are negative words, and he declares he will not visit, no visitatorial power remains; but those words must be very plain to show his intent; because the nature of the thing is so strongly against it, that the persons, in whose hands the money is, and whose interest it is to misapply it, would be UNACCOUNTABLE and irresponsible; so that the words should be very plain to show so unreasonable an intention; if they are so, no more is to be said, but stet pro ratione voluntas ."
333,Eden v Foster,1 January 1725,(1725) 2 Peere Williams 325,Ct of Chancery,,1,"And therefore, 4 thly , That in those cases where the governors or visitors are said not to be accountable , it must be intended, where such governors have the power of government only, and not where they have the 1 legal estate and are intrusted with the receipt of the rents and profits (as in the present case), for it would be of the most pernicious consequence imaginable, that any person intrusted with the receipts of rents and profits, and especially for a charity, though they [327] misemploy never so much these rents and profits, should yet be UNACCOUNTABLE for their receipts; this would be such a privilege as might of itself be a temptation to a breach of trust."
334,Burr v Davall,1 January 1722,(1722) 8 Modern 59,Court of King's Bench,1,,"A will, well executed, shall not be set aside, or the testator considered non compos mentis , on account of the dispositions therein being imprudent or UNACCOUNTABLE."
335,Adam Cusack v Elinor Cusack,10 May 1714,(1714) V Brown 116,House of Lords,1,,"King), that by the articles in question, Robert Cusack was tenant in tail; the words being, that the estate should come to the heirs male of his body; which could never be designed to take away his own estate, and it would be very UNACCOUNTABLE, by guessing at intentions, to deprive children of their portions and necessary maintenance."
336,The King v Hornby,1 January 1700,(1700) 5 Modern 29,Court of King's Bench,1,,"[52] I shall conclude this point with this observation, that since there were two great powers in the Barons (as is pretended), one of bringing in money into the Exchequer, and the other of paying it out, that yet these books should be all silent as to the greatest power of paying it out, is very strange and UNACCOUNTABLE; which indeed does induce me to believe, that there is no such power in the Barons, and that those petitioners have mentioned in their petition the only way of having their annuities; that is, as their former payments were made, viz."
337,"Sir William Leagh & al' v J. Thomson, Lessee of Charles Leach",1 January 1698,(1698) Shower 150,House of Lords,1,,"'Tis a Rule UNACCOUNTABLE, That a Man shall not stultify himself; that he shall not be able to excuse himself by the Visitation of Heaven, when he may plead Duress from Men, to avoid his own Act."
338,"In the Middle Temple—Hall, Com' Mountague & alii v Com. Bathen. & al', & econ'",12 December 1693,(1693) 3 Cases in Chancery 55,Ct of Chancery,1,,"Now after all this, that the Duke should make his last Will, and give all this Estate to a Stranger (for so as to any Thing appears in Proof) and give nothing to the Earl of Bath , when by the former Settlement he had given him such hopes of so great a Share; this I think is a very UNACCOUNTABLE Thing; and, I confess, I know not how to extricate my self out of the Confusion it causes in me; but I must set the one against the other as to that Objection, and leave the Matter in the dark, as to the Duke's Honour, as I found it; tho', I think, I may give a further Answer to this Objection under the second Head."
339,Lord Townsend v Dr. Hughes,1 January 1676,(1676) 2 Modern 150,Court of King's Bench,1,,"The jury in this case ought to have respect only to the damage which the plaintiff sustained, and not to do an UNACCOUNTABLE thing that he might have an opportunity to shew himself generous; and as the Court ought with one eye to look upon the verdict, so with the other they ought to take notice what is contained in the declaration, and then to consider whether the words and damages bear any proportion; if not, then the Court ought to lay their hands upon the verdict: it is true, they cannot lessen the damages, but if they are too great the Court may grant a new trial."
340,"Jeffreson, Executor of Jeffreson v Morton, and Dawson, and Others, Tertenants of Yarway",1 January 1668,(1668) 2 WMS. Saunders 6,Court of King's Bench,1,,"If a scire facias be against the heir alone, it is said that he is not entitled to receive contribution from a purchaser; which seems rather UNACCOUNTABLE, as the heir is chargeable only as tenant of the land; but if there be several heirs, such as parceners, heirs in gavelkind, or borough English, and one only be charged, he is entitled to contribution from the other heirs, and therefore may plead this plea."
341,Emery and Others v Cichero,21 November 1883,(1883) 9 App. Cas. 136,Privy Council,1,,"That she, the Bunin , kept her course; but that the Arklow , by some UNACCOUNTABLE mismanagement, as it is stated, ran into the Bunin , striking her about the fore rigging on the starboard side with her stern."
342,"M'Kew v Holland, Hannen, Cubitts (Scotland) Ltd.",26 November 1969,1970 S.C. (H.L.) 20,House of Lords,1,,"If, on the other hand, the action which resulted in the injury was something UNACCOUNTABLE, “a new cause which disturbs the sequence of events, something which can be described as either unreasonable or extraneous or extrinsic,” the chain of causation is broken."
343,Tenison Edwards and Wife v A. B. Warden and Others and the Secretary of State for India,7 April 1876,(1876) 1 App. Cas. 281,House of Lords,1,,That there has been UNACCOUNTABLE delay in asserting the claim cannot be denied; and a question arises from what time this delay must be taken to have prejudiced the right to which Mrs.
345,Robert Gardner v Mary Gardner,30 May 1876,(1876) 3 R. 695,"Court of Session, 2d Division",1,,"Nor do I think it improves the position of the pursuer, but, on the contrary, renders his conduct all the more UNACCOUNTABLE, that *717  on his ascertaining, before the marriage, the condition in which his wife was, she refused to disclose to him the name of the individual with whom she must have had illicit intercourse, notwithstanding that he desired and pressed her to do so."
346,Crane Appellant; v Director of Public Prosecutions Respondent.,6 June 1921,[1921] 2 A.C. 299,House of Lords,1,,"If some adequate substitute be not expressly or impliedly provided for the valuable machinery which is thus taken away, one would be forced to the conclusion that a mischievous and UNACCOUNTABLE blunder, most hurtful to the subject and embarrassing in the administration of justice, had been committed in the drafting of the Act."
