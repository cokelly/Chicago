R Functions and codebooks relating to paper for ASPA 2015, Chicago

At the moment, I have footnoted remarks about the use of the word 'unaccountable' in (largely) UK case law.

What I mean is that I have isolated data from a keyword search on Westlaw, processed it, and manually read through to assign meanings to each use of the word. A csv file containing all results is available for download [here](https://github.com/cokelly/Chicago/blob/master/Unaccountability/unaccountability.csv).

A code book with guidance is contained [here](https://github.com/cokelly/Chicago/blob/master/Unaccountability/unaccountability%20codebook.Rmd).

Two relevant functions are [here](https://github.com/cokelly/Chicago/blob/master/Unaccountability/Westlaw%20Cases%20Function.R) and [here](https://github.com/cokelly/Chicago/blob/master/Unaccountability/IsolateKey.R).
